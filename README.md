# Studdy Buddy
## Created by Latoyya, Wesley, Dan, John, and Stevie :)

### Built using:

      - React
      - Express / MongoDB
      - Jquery
      - Bootstrap

# Remember these commands during development:
1: mongod --dbpath cardsTest 
      - This command starts up the mongo deamon along with dummy database. Run this before running the second command.
2: yarn run dev 
      - Starts up both client and backend servers.
